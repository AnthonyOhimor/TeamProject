## Welcome to Starship Wars 
 
Starship Wars takes place in the NGC 4696 elliptical galaxy, 114 million light years from Earth. In the year 3092, Neptilians are intergalactic alien raiders who drain the dark-matter from neighbouring galaxies, causing the galaxy to weaken and black holes to open, destroying whole worlds that once teamed with life. The Darknauts are space rangers formed by an intergovernmental military alliance between 28 galaxies. They seek to destroy the Neptilians and restore order to the universe. 
 
As the Darknauts pull a Neptilian craft out of hyperspace, players will take the side of either faction, battling it out, changing the fate of the universe

>Out with the old. In with the new. Due to budget cuts a number of members were let go. However our passion to make games remains strong. This is why we are shelving Treasure Twins for the time being and pooling all our resources into delivering Starship Wars for all our fans <br>
