## Treasure Twins
 Game scope reduction due to technical difficulties and an unfamiliarity with the new necessary tools and languages. Difficult to design and implement particular game elements due to a lack of online resources closely relating to our unique game idea.

A change in the game at this point is to be discussed to enable further resources to become available. An excessively optimistic scope was initially set out with the Treasure Twins game.

**Back to the drawing board**! Rock Paper Scissors discussed as an MVP. To be iterated over extensively to transform the simple game into a fun duel game!

Incorporating many more features to the RPS game, such as hand gestures, taunts, live chat, lives, power-ups, and a variety of different game modes and conditions changing the nature of the game.

The theme continued from the Treasure Twins, whereby the duel is ultimately the ultimatum that was discussed in the initial game. Both Bruce and Beatrice have reached the treasure but only one can escape with the treasure alive! And so much duel to escape to live a life of riches.
