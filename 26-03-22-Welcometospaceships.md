# welcome to Starship wars

Starship Wars takes place in the NGC 4696 elliptical galaxy, 114 million light-years from Earth. In the year 3092, Neptilians are intergalactic alien raiders who drain the dark matter from neighboring galaxies, causing the galaxy to weaken and black holes to open, destroying whole worlds that once teamed with life. The Darknauts are space rangers formed by an intergovernmental military alliance between 28 galaxies. <br>

They seek to destroy the Neptilians and restore order to the universe As the Darknauts pull a Neptilian craft out of hyperspace, players will take the side of either faction, battling it out, changing the fate of the universe. <br>
