Jekyll is a static site generator that takes markdown syntax and converts to html script instead of using a database.<br>

Jekyll also supports loading content from JSON AND YAML files. It is the most common static site generator because of its adoption by github <br>

As a team, we had certain members struggling to use other tools like WordPress and HTML to make our website. This problem was having a negative impact on the overall health of the project. It was wise we looked for alternatives.<br>

Considering the time frame jekyll was a very vaible choice for us as it is quick to understand and there are provided documentation to guide you through.<br>

Jekyll was originally released by Tom Preston in early 2008. It was then taken over by Parker Moore, who led the effort in releasing Jekyll 1.

Jekyll can be used in with some front end frame work like [Boot-strap](https://getbootstrap.com) and many others.<br>

Jekyll also provides documentation for new users, which is quite easy to understand. [Jekyll-documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) <br>

Jekyll is the engine behind [Git-hub-pages](https://github.com) Which can be used to host sites right from your repository.
