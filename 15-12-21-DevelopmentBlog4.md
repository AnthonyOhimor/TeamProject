## Rock Paper Scissors 
> The teams experience producing The Hack has led them to believe it is not feasible to develop a product of sufficient quality in time for the Minimum Viable Product if they continue on the same path.
>
>A lack of online available resources relating closely to the plan we initially had in place caused for a shift in game to one with referencing information to help the development of the game. The team decided to reduce the scope of the game considerably to have clearer and more refined increments
>
>The team propose to switch development to one of their secondary game ideas - an online, competitive version of the common game Rock, Paper, Scissors.<br>

>Our brief was to develop a turn-based, multiplayer game in a short span of months. We need to develop incrementally to meet certain milestones: the hack, the minimum viable product, and the release. The team's primary idea was to develop a collaborative, online puzzle game with  a 2d-side scroller design, a variety of intellectually challenging puzzles and multiple levels for replayability. The process of developing a basic product for the hack lead the team to doubt the feasibility of this idea for satisfying the brief. The reasons for this difficulty are listed below <br>

>-Timescale - The time sunk into developing a sample scenario for the hack was not matched by the quality of the product developed. The team spent a significant number of hours prior to the milestone working on the product, however as their knowledge of the Unity game engine increased, the belief in their ability to deliver a good quality, well-crafted and fun game reduced. With the current levels of Human Capital available, the goal as it stood would not be achievable<br>

>-Design - The team believed they had an interesting premise for their game, an adventure/turn-based/puzzle/multiplayer journey through a hidden temple. To make that a reality the number of components needed was sizeable - scenes for different levels, scenes for different puzzles, timing to ensure turn-based mechanics are working. As the team is new to game development, they found this complex to build into reality<br>
